#Goals 
Main objective is to get a basic understanding of Rest APIs and Node JS by creating an api that performs basic CRUD operations on a remote DB, maybe a mongo DB or a Firebase. 

Secondary goals are: 
    1) Create a React front end with form inputs that allow a user to modify the data through the API. 
    2) Write good documentation that is easy to understand and follow
